I mostly cosplay Regretevator (kinda), PHIGHTING!, or Sprunki.

Some other fandoms I'm in are Pressure, Mlp, DW, WOF, BSD, and HfjONE.

I'm mostly in the PHIGHTING! area of ponytown.

I'm a very quiet person, and may be dry at some point of time if I don't know you that much. But i do still allow conversations, but sometimes pls whisper to me! I'm mostly offtab nd i will feel guilty and upset if i didn't get a message from you. Yes i am a quiet person, but i do enjoy being with friends, since i become hypractive and more talkative. I always giggle and kick my feet when talking with friends <3. I sometimes lose interest in stuff, but i'll still chat for a little. I'm a very sleepy person so i accidentally fall asleep while ingame sometimes. Compliments make me flustered and all giggling :3 i love them <3. I will be confused at some things, and not able to answer, so its unintentional if i stop talking. I take a long time to think of stuff. I sometimes purposely misspell words, usually i do it on my friends / oomfies <3. C&H is free with nuzzles and boops, i don't mind, i actually love when people are close to me, since i mostly spend my pt alone. I sometimes make harmful or sexual jokes, so if you do get uncomfortable, please let me know, i don't want to cause any uncomfortable actions or discomfort. I do get sometimes flustered at the fact of being called 'dear', 'darling', or 'sugar'. I kiss my friends / oomfies as an action of affection (if you don't like this, please tell me). I'm trans, FtM, but I use any pronouns, just mostly he/him. yeahhh thats it.
